# UnderRLTagger

------ Requirements ------

-Python 3.x Installed.

-Required Python libraries: os, codecs, tkinter, nltk

------ Installation ------

This software does not need to be installed. You only need to download the UnderRL_Tagger_py.zip file and unzip it into a folder; preferably that folder should be in the root of the C: \ disk to avoid inconveniences. Once unzipped, you only need to run the UnderRL_Tagger.py file through Python. When executing it, a blank console will be displayed, you must wait a few moments until the program shows its main window. Once it is displayed, avoid closing the console.

------ Recommendations ------

-Do not delete or change any of the files or folders found when unzipping UnderRL_Tagger_py.zip, as the program will search for each one of them.

-In case of making mistakes in labels that are saved in the dictionary, it is possible to directly enter the dictionary file to change them manually. This file will be found in the dict folder.

-The generated dictionary files should not be deleted, as they can be used to continue tagging projects in the same language. We encourage dissemination and collaboration on these files to achieve and share better and better results.

-For more information on how the program works, it is recommended to read this work: http://bibliotecadigital.udea.edu.co/bitstream/10495/16570/2/PembertyJose_2020_EtiquetadoSemiautom%c3%a1ticoUnder-resourced.pdf
